    The Covid Project was created to find data on the social media presence of COVID-19

    twint -s 'covidproject' --csv --output twint.csv

    twint scrapes Twitter's search results and writes the results as CSV. The
    tweet identifiers were extracted from this CSV and included as the ids.txt
    file.
