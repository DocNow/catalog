2017 Catalonia attacks were a terrorism action against pedestrians who were at La Rambla (Barcelona) and beach promenade of Cambrils on the afternoon and night of 17-18th August 2017. We selected #NoTincPor hashtag because it was the motto of the demonstrations during that period and was the most positive message. No one knew how the situation would go so the best option was to collect the dataset using the search API and limit by time between August 17 - 26, which was the final demonstration in Barcelona for the victims.
