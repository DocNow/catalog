EveTAR test collection, the first Arabic freely-available Test Collection  for multiple information retrieval tasks in Twitter. It supports  Event Detection (ED), Ad-hoc search (AS), Timeline generation (TTG), Real-time  summarization (RTS).  EveTAR includes a crawl of 355M Arabic tweets and covers  50 significant events for which about 62K tweets were judged with substantial  average inter-annotator agreement (Kappa value of 0.71). Besides the full  collection (EveTAR-F), we provide four different subsets of EveTAR:  (1) EveTAR-S: Random sample of 15M tweets (2) EveTAR-S.m: MSA tweets of the sample  (3) EveTAR-S.d: Dialectal tweets of the sample  (4) EveTAR-Q: Judged tweets only
