This dataset was released by Twitter on October 17, 2018 in order to provide transparency for state sponsored propaganda that was alleged to have occurred on their platform in the lead up to and directly following the 2016 Presidential Election. The original dataset of deleted content was downloaded from Twitter and deposited at the Internet Archive by Ed Summers.
