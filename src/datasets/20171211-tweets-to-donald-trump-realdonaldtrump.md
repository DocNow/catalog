238,991,027 tweet ids for tweets directed at Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), collected with Documenting the Now's twarc. Tweets can be "rehydrated" with Documenting the Now's twarc, or Hydrator. twarc hydrate to_realdonaldtrump_ids.txt > to_donaltrump.jsonl. Tweets from May 7, 2017 - June 21, 2017 of the dataset used a combination of the Filter (Streaming) API and Search API. The Filter API failed on June 21, 2017. From June 23, 2017 forward only the Search API was used to collect. This is done every 5 days on a cron job. Collection is ongoing, and this dataset will be periodically updated with additional tweet ids sets.
