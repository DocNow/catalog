The Unite the Right rally (also known as the Charlottesville rally) was a protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States from August 11â€“12, 2017, to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park, which itself was renamed from Lee Park two months earlier. Protesters included white supremacists, white nationalists, neo-Confederates, neo-Nazis, and militias.
