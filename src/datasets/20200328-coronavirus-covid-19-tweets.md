This dataset includes more than 100 million tweet IDs related to the Coronavirus outbreak of 2019-2020. It is being added to over time, so the  numbers and dates may change. The tweets have been collected by the LSTM model deployed at sentiment.live. The model monitors the real-time Twitter feed for coronavirus-related tweets, using filters: language “en”, and keywords “corona”, "coronavirus", "covid", "covid19" and variants of "sarscov2". The CSV files include columns: tweet ID,  sentiment score. The dataset should be solely used for non-commercial research purpose.
