A list of 24876 Twitter IDs for tweets harvested between Nov. 28 and Dec. 6 2014 containing the hashtag #bill10. Bill 10 in the Alberta legislature would have given public and Catholic school boards the right to refuse student requests to form gay-straight alliances in schools. Under intense public interest it was withdrawn by the Conservative government.
