This dataset contains the tweet ids of 39,695,156 tweets collected from the Twitter accounts of aproximately 4,500 news outlets, i.e., accounts of media organizations intended to disseminate news. The media organizations include everything from local U.S. newspapers to foreign television stations. They were collected between August 4, 2016 and July 20, 2018 from the Twitter API using Social Feed Manager. Note that not all accounts may have been collected for the entire duration and there may be tweets from before the time period. We intend to update this dataset periodically.
