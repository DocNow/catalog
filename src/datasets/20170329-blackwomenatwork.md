The hashtag #BlackWomenAtWork began trending following Fox News host, Bill O'Reilly's sexist and racist comments about California Congresswoman's Maxine Water's hair on March 28th, 2017 and White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer's remarks to journalist, April Ryan during press briefing on the same day. The hashtag began trending after Brittany Packnett used it in a set of tweets where she asked black women to share their experiences about being black women at work. These tweet ids were collected on four separate occasions using the DocNow prototype twitter collection tool. bwaw1 (10,000 tweets), bwaw2 (41,256 tweets), bwaw3 (92,756 tweets) were collected on March 28th, the day the hashtag began trending. bwaw4 (140,000 tweets) was collected on March 29th.
