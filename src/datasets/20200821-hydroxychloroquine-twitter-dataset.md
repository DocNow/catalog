This dataset contains Twitter JSON data for several Twitter search queries that were collected related to the drug hydroxychloroquine and its relationship as an effective coronavirus treatment. This dataset was created to capture the opinions on Twitter after a group of people calling themselves "Americaâ€™s Frontline Doctors" released a video sharing misleading claims about the virus and the use of the drug as an effective treatment. This dataset was created using the twarc (https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) package that makes use of Twitter's search API. A total of 4,187,890 Tweets and 15,779 media files make up the combined dataset.
