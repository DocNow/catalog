On February 27, 2018 the National Museum of African American History and Culture hosted a Twitter chat with the Documenting the Now project.  Bergis Jules from the Documenting the Now team coordinated the project responses and delivered them as the @documentnow user on Twitter. Other people from the project and elsewehere responded. The event started at 9:30 AM EST and finished at 10:30 AM EST. Tweets with the designated hashtag #ArchivesBlackHistory were collected using twarc at 11:30 AM on Feburary 27, 2018. It collected 1402 tweets, some of which were created prior to the twitter chat, since it has been used in other promotional outreach by the NMAAHC.
