This dataset contains the tweet ids of 63,707 tweets posted by the Twitter accounts of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters as well as affiliated locals. The purpose of the collection was to document the experience of Teamsters members as front line workers, as well as the union's role in supporting its members, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This data was collected as part of the IBT COVID-19 Response Collection at George Washington University Libraries Special Collections (https://searcharchives.library.gwu.edu/repositories/2/resources/856). Tweets were collected between May 8, 2020 and Feb. 23, 2022, from the GET statuses/user_timeline method of the Twitter v1 REST API using Social Feed Manager. Collecting from the Twitter timelines harvested some tweets that were posted prior to the collection date, so this collection includes tweets posted as far back as 2009.
