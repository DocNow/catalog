The #blackwomanhood Twitter chat took place on May 10th, 2018. It was a discussion around the syllabus for the Black Womanhood course taught by Martha Jones and Jessica Marie Johnson at Johns Hopkins University. The discussion coincided with the end of the course. http://dh.jmjafrx.com/2018/01/27/black-womanhood-the-syllabus/
