This dataset contains 17,292,130 tweet ids for tweets collected from the Twitter filter stream API for #blm and #blacklivesmatter between 2016-01-29 and 2017-03-18. The data was collected using the twarc utility. The files are broken into segments because of network connectivity problems that were encountered during data collection. So there are varying time gaps present between the files. Also when the hashtags were trending globally rate limits may have prevented some tweets from being streamed over the API.
