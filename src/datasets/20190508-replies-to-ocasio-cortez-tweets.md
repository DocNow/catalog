Any replies to Tweets and Retweets by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Tweets and Retweets in March 2019. Includes Green New Deal developments, MSNBC town hall with Chris Hayes, links to articles. Some retweets surfaced older Tweets and their replies from before March 2019. Replies to a Tweet were captured manually with a TamperMonkey userscript (https://github.com/mapmeld/aoc_reply_dataset/blob/master/scan.js) because there is no equivalent API endpoint.
