Invited speakers discussed their work on the Black experience in online spaces including research on joy and creativity expressed by Black people on the web, cultural and social expression, activism and other acts of resistance, the Black experience with state sponsored online surveillance, and racism and bias in algorithm and social media platform design. The program was an opportunity for the general public, activists, archivists, library and museum professionals, and the academic community, to learn and share together in conversations about digital culture and digital archives that center blackness.</p>"

    "description": "<p>University of Glasgow’s unique Integrated Multimedia City Data (iMCD) Survey is a cross-sectional survey based on a sample of the general population in private residences across eight local authority areas of Glasgow and Clyde Valley. The purpose of the iMCD dataset was to provide a 360° overview of a life in the city, combining various datasets and methods of collection.\nThe survey fieldwork was run by Ipsos MORI and took place between 15th April 2015 and 21st November 2015. This project was funded by ESRC and it was a result of collaboration across the University of Glasgow, Newcastle and Sheffield. The intention was to provide new innovative datasets with new methods and methodologies that could be used by the policy makers.\niMCD consists of 5 main strands (Survey, GPS, life-logging devices, image analysis, textual media and multimedia data). The core of the iMCD is the Household Survey. Each of the five data strands are built on unique models of data sampling. As a part of the project, we also collected for example a sample of GPS and lifelogging sensors. Lifelogging sensors collected data through GPS devices and wearable cameras.\nConcurrent to the collection of the iMCD Household Survey data UBDC researchers have undertaken a significant information extraction exercise to capture data streams related to Glasgow from a variety of online sources. Twitter data comprises a large part of this collection, and this dataset comprises a selection of tweets during the period 1/12/14 - 30/11/2015 that arose from the greater Glasgow area. This, for example, may give insights into the citizens’ behaviour, reactions and moods in certain contexts or at particular times. The dataset can be queried through a bespoke online tool by specific hashtag or tweet term, in order to return statistical information or specific Tweet IDs.  Captured tweets were those geolocated in Glasgow (based on a polygon around the geography), those from certain known Glasgow accounts (e.g. @BBCWestScot; @policescotland) and containing certain terms or hashtags (e.g. glasgow, or #glasgow2014).\nTweets from Glasgow users: BBCWestScot, DailyMailUK, BBCScotWeather, GlasgowCC, Daily<em>Record, GLA</em>Airport, WeatherCast<em>UK, STVGlasgow, glabreakingnews, GreaterGlasgPol, OpenGlasgow, TheEveningTimes, trafficscotland, policescotland, Herald</em>editor, TheScotsman, scotairquality, GdnScotland, PeopleMakeGLA, EverttHerald, GlasgowSubway, newsundayherlad, EducationScot, TheSunNewspaper, TravelineScot, BBCTravelScot, CBItweets, MetroUK, FristinGlasgow, PeopleMakeGLA, FoEScot gtcs, WhatsOnGlasgow, scdiglobal, edhubSctoland, Heart_Glasgow\nTweet with certain terms or hashtags: glasgow, BetterTogether, GlasgowCC, Yougov, glasgow2014, CommonWealthGame, GlasgowRoads, scotnight, indyref, CWG2014, goforitscotland, BBCScotWeather, scotdecides, VoteYes, NoThanks, the45, Scotland, yesScotland, AlexSalmond, CommonWealthGames, NoBecause, VoteNo, Darling, train, undecided, HopeOverFear, PatronisingBTlady</p>"
