With social media often dictating the tones and trends of politics-related discussion, it is of paramount importance to be able to study online chatter, especially in the run up to important voting events, like in the case of the upcoming November 3, 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Limited access to social media data is often the first barrier to impede, hinder, or slow down progress, and ultimately our understanding of online political discourse.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this issue and try to empower the Computational Social Science research community, we decided to publicly release a massive-scale, longitudinal dataset of U.S. politics and election related tweets. This multilingual dataset that we have been collecting for over one year encompasses hundreds of millions of tweets and tracks all salient U.S. politics trends, actors, and events between 2019 and 2020. The dataset predates and spans the whole period of Republican and Democratic primaries, with real-time tracking of all presidential contenders of both sides of the isle. After that, it focuses on presidential and vice-presidential candidates. </p>\n<p>Our dataset release is curated, documented and will be constantly updated on a weekly-basis, until the November 3, 2020 election and beyond. We hope that the academic community, computational journalists, and research practitioners alike will all take advantage of our dataset to study relevant scientific and social issues, including problems like misinformation, information manipulation, interference, and distortion of online political discourse that have been prevalent in the context of recent election events in the United States and worldwide.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00600\">#Election2020: The First Public Twitter Dataset on the 2020 US Presidential Election</a> for details about how and why this dataset was assembled.

    "description": "<p>GeoCoV19 is a large-scale Twitter dataset related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset has been collected over a period of 90 days from February 1 to May 1, 2020 and consists of more than 524 million multilingual tweets. As the geolocation information is essential for many tasks such as disease tracking and surveillance, we employed a gazetteer-based approach to extract toponyms from user location and tweet content to derive their geolocation information using the Nominatim (Open Street Maps) data at different geolocation granularity levels. In terms of geographical coverage, the dataset spans over 218 countries and 47K cities in the world. The tweets in the dataset are from more than 43 million Twitter users, including around 209K verified accounts. These users posted tweets in 62 different languages. We posit that GeoCoV19 affords the ability to develop computational models to have a better understanding of how societies are collectively coping with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the dataset can inform the development of AI-based systems to forecast disease outbreaks as well as provide surveillance for authorities to act timely, learn about knowledge gaps and urgent needs of the general public, identify unanticipated issues, and tackle misinformation and fake news, among others.</p>"

    "description": "<p>This dataset is distributed by Daniel Gayo-Avello, an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Oviedo, for the sole purpose of non-commercial research and it just includes tweet ids.</p>\n<p>The dataset contains tweet IDs for all the published tweets (in any language) between March 21, 2006 and July 31, 2009 thus comprising the first whole three years of Twitter from its creation, that is, about 1.5 billion tweets (see file <em>Twitter-historical-20060321-20090731.zip</em>).</p>\n<p>It covers several defining issues in Twitter, such as the invention of hashtags, retweets and trending topics, and it includes tweets related to the 2008 US Presidential Elections, the first Obama’s inauguration speech or the 2009 Iran Election protests (one of the so-called Twitter Revolutions).</p>\n<p>Finally, it does contain tweets in many major languages (mainly English, Portuguese, Japanese, Spanish, German and French) so it should be possible–at least in theory–to analyze international events from different cultural perspectives.</p>\n<p>The dataset was completed in November 2016 and, therefore, the tweet IDs it contains were publicly available at that moment. This means that there could be tweets public during that period that do not appear in the dataset and also that a substantial part of tweets in the dataset has been deleted (or locked) since 2016.</p>\n<p>To make easier to understand the decay of tweet IDs in the dataset a number of representative samples (99% confidence level and 0.5 confidence interval) are provided.</p>\n<p>In general terms, 85.5% ±0.5 of the historical tweets are available as of May 19, 2020 (see file<em>Twitter-historical-20060321-20090731-sample.txt</em>). However, since the amount of tweets vary greatly throughout the period of three years covered in the dataset, additional representative samples are provided for 90-day intervals (see the file<em>90-day-samples.zip</em>).</p>\n<p>In that regard, the ratio of publicly available tweets (as of May 19, 2020) is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>March 21, 2006 to June 18, 2006: 88.4% ±0.5 (from 5,512 tweets).</li>\n<li>June 18, 2006 to September 16, 2006: 82.7% ±0.5 (from 14,820 tweets).</li>\n<li>September 16, 2006 to December 15, 2006: 85.7% ±0.5 (from 107,975 tweets).</li>\n<li>December 15, 2006 to March 15, 2007: 88.2% ±0.5 (from 852,463 tweets).</li>\n<li>March 15, 2007 to June 13, 2007: 89.6% ±0.5 (from 6,341,665 tweets).</li>\n<li>June 13, 2007 to September 11, 2007: 88.6% ±0.5 (from 11,171,090 tweets).</li>\n<li>September 11, 2007 to December 10, 2007: 87.9% ±0.5 (from 15,545,532 tweets).</li>\n<li>December 10, 2007 to March 9, 2008: 89.0% ±0.5 (from 23,164,663 tweets).</li>\n<li>March 9, 2008 to June 7, 2008: 66.5% ±0.5 (from 56,416,772 tweets; see below for more details on this).</li>\n<li>June 7, 2008 to September 5, 2008: 78.3% ±0.5 (from 62,868,189 tweets; see below for more details on this).</li>\n<li>September 5, 2008 to December 4, 2008: 87.3% ±0.5 (from 89,947,498 tweets).</li>\n<li>December 4, 2008 to March 4, 2009: 86.9% ±0.5 (from 169,762,425 tweets).</li>\n<li>March 4, 2009 to June 2, 2009: 86.4% ±0.5 (from 474,581,170 tweets).</li>\n<li>June 2, 2009 to July 31, 2009: 85.7% ±0.5 (from 589,116,341 tweets).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The apparent drop in available tweets from March 9, 2008 to September 5, 2008 has an easy, although embarrassing, explanation.</p>\n<p>At the moment of cleaning all the data to publish this dataset there seemed to be a gap between April 1, 2008 to July 7, 2008 (actually, the data was not missing but in a different backup). Since tweet IDs are easy to regenerate for that Twitter era (source code is provided in<em>generate-ids.m</em>) I simply produced all those that were created between those two dates. All those tweets actually existed but a number of them were obviously private and not crawlable. For those regenerated IDs the actual ratio of public tweets (as of May 19, 2020) is 62.3% ±0.5.</p>\n<p>In other words, what you see in that period (April to July, 2008) is not actually a huge number of tweets having been deleted but the combination of deleted *and* non-public tweets (whose IDs should not be in the dataset for performance purposes when rehydrating the dataset).</p>\n<p>Additionally, given that not everybody will need the whole period of time the earliest tweet ID for each date is provided in the file <em>date-tweet-id.tsv</em>.</p>\n<p>For additional details regarding this dataset please see: Gayo-Avello, Daniel. (2016) <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08144\">How I Stopped Worrying about the Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress and Learned to Build a Little One for Myself</a></em>. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.08144.</p>\n<p><strong>If you use this dataset in any way please cite that preprint</strong> (in addition to the dataset itself).</p>\n<p>If you need to contact me you can find me as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pfcdgayo\">@PFCdgayo</a> in Twitter.</p>"

    "description": "<p>University of Glasgow’s unique Integrated Multimedia City Data (iMCD) Survey is a cross-sectional survey based on a sample of the general population in private residences across eight local authority areas of Glasgow and Clyde Valley. The purpose of the iMCD dataset was to provide a 360° overview of a life in the city, combining various datasets and methods of collection.\nThe survey fieldwork was run by Ipsos MORI and took place between 15th April 2015 and 21st November 2015. This project was funded by ESRC and it was a result of collaboration across the University of Glasgow, Newcastle and Sheffield. The intention was to provide new innovative datasets with new methods and methodologies that could be used by the policy makers.\niMCD consists of 5 main strands (Survey, GPS, life-logging devices, image analysis, textual media and multimedia data). The core of the iMCD is the Household Survey. Each of the five data strands are built on unique models of data sampling. As a part of the project, we also collected for example a sample of GPS and lifelogging sensors. Lifelogging sensors collected data through GPS devices and wearable cameras.\nConcurrent to the collection of the iMCD Household Survey data UBDC researchers have undertaken a significant information extraction exercise to capture data streams related to Glasgow from a variety of online sources. Twitter data comprises a large part of this collection, and this dataset comprises a selection of tweets during the period 1/12/14 - 30/11/2015 that arose from the greater Glasgow area. This, for example, may give insights into the citizens’ behaviour, reactions and moods in certain contexts or at particular times. The dataset can be queried through a bespoke online tool by specific hashtag or tweet term, in order to return statistical information or specific Tweet IDs.  Captured tweets were those geolocated in Glasgow (based on a polygon around the geography), those from certain known Glasgow accounts (e.g. @BBCWestScot; @policescotland) and containing certain terms or hashtags (e.g. glasgow, or #glasgow2014).\nTweets from Glasgow users: BBCWestScot, DailyMailUK, BBCScotWeather, GlasgowCC, Daily<em>Record, GLA</em>Airport, WeatherCast<em>UK, STVGlasgow, glabreakingnews, GreaterGlasgPol, OpenGlasgow, TheEveningTimes, trafficscotland, policescotland, Herald</em>editor, TheScotsman, scotairquality, GdnScotland, PeopleMakeGLA, EverttHerald, GlasgowSubway, newsundayherlad, EducationScot, TheSunNewspaper, TravelineScot, BBCTravelScot, CBItweets, MetroUK, FristinGlasgow, PeopleMakeGLA, FoEScot gtcs, WhatsOnGlasgow, scdiglobal, edhubSctoland, Heart_Glasgow\nTweet with certain terms or hashtags: glasgow, BetterTogether, GlasgowCC, Yougov, glasgow2014, CommonWealthGame, GlasgowRoads, scotnight, indyref, CWG2014, goforitscotland, BBCScotWeather, scotdecides, VoteYes, NoThanks, the45, Scotland, yesScotland, AlexSalmond, CommonWealthGames, NoBecause, VoteNo, Darling, train, undecided, HopeOverFear, PatronisingBTlady</p>"

Invited speakers discussed their work on the Black experience in online spaces including research on joy and creativity expressed by Black people on the web, cultural and social expression, activism and other acts of resistance, the Black experience with state sponsored online surveillance, and racism and bias in algorithm and social media platform design. The program was an opportunity for the general public, activists, archivists, library and museum professionals, and the academic community, to learn and share together in conversations about digital culture and digital archives that center blackness.</p>"
