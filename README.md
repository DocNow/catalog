**catalog** is a minimal registry of tweet identifier datasets. You can add a
dataset of your own through the [interface](https://catalog.docnow.io/admin/), or by adding markdown file to the [src/datasets](https://github.com/DocNow/catalog/tree/master/src/datasets) directory here in this repository (if you want to do it the hard way).

You can read a blog post about the rationale for the Catalog, including what its purpose is, and why it is a static site here:
