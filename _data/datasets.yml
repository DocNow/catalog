  description: >
    This dataset contains 14,108,104 tweets that document the mass shooting that
    occurred in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 1, 2017. Data were gathered via
    concurrent queries to the Twitter search API for all tweets containing the term
    "vegas", occurring September 29 - October 7 before 5:00 PM PT. Because of the
    volume, and the fact that the tweets were being recorded after the event, but
    within the 7 day time window of the search API, the data was collected by
    limiting the search to a particular day, for example, "vegas until:2017-10-03",
    "vegas until:2017-10-04", "vegas until:2017-10-05", etc. The resulting JSON
    data was then deduplicated using twarc's deduplicate.py utility, the identifers
    were then sorted chronologically.

    University of Glasgow’s unique Integrated Multimedia City Data (iMCD)
    Survey is a cross-sectional survey based on a sample of the general
    population in private residences across eight local authority areas of
    Glasgow and Clyde Valley. The purpose of the iMCD dataset was to provide a
    360° overview of a life in the city, combining various datasets and
    methods of collection.

    The survey fieldwork was run by Ipsos MORI and took place between 15th
    April 2015 and 21st November 2015. This project was funded by ESRC and it
    was a result of collaboration across the University of Glasgow, Newcastle
    and Sheffield. The intention was to provide new innovative datasets with
    new methods and methodologies that could be used by the policy makers.

    iMCD consists of 5 main strands (Survey, GPS, life-logging devices, image
    analysis, textual media and multimedia data). The core of the iMCD is the
    Household Survey. Each of the five data strands are built on unique models
    of data sampling. As a part of the project, we also collected for example
    a sample of GPS and lifelogging sensors. Lifelogging sensors collected
    data through GPS devices and wearable cameras.

    Concurrent to the collection of the iMCD Household Survey data UBDC
    researchers have undertaken a significant information extraction exercise
    to capture data streams related to Glasgow from a variety of online
    sources. Twitter data comprises a large part of this collection, and this
    dataset comprises a selection of tweets during the period 1/12/14 -
    30/11/2015 that arose from the greater Glasgow area. This, for example,
    may give insights into the citizens’ behaviour, reactions and moods in
    certain contexts or at particular times. The dataset can be queried
    through a bespoke online tool by specific hashtag or tweet term, in order
    to return statistical information or specific Tweet IDs.  Captured tweets
    were those geolocated in Glasgow (based on a polygon around the
    geography), those from certain known Glasgow accounts (e.g. @BBCWestScot;
    @policescotland) and containing certain terms or hashtags (e.g. glasgow,
    or #glasgow2014).

    "BlackDigArchive" and 1,888 tweets collected using the hashtag
    "#BlackDigArchive". The second Documenting the Now symposium, "Digital
    Blackness in the Archive", was held on December 11th and 12th, 2017 and
    addressed issues at the intersection of archival practice and the existence
    of Black people on the web and social media. Invited speakers discussed
    their work on the Black experience in online spaces including research on
    joy and creativity expressed by Black people on the web, cultural and social
    expression, activism and other acts of resistance, the Black experience with
    state sponsored online surveillance, and racism and bias in algorithm and
    social media platform design. The program was an opportunity for the general
    public, activists, archivists, library and museum professionals, and the
    academic community, to learn and share together in conversations about
    digital culture and digital archives that center blackness.

    The data collection was a collaboration with Vicenç Ruiz Gómez and Aniol

    Summers of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities.
    The hashtags were selected after monitoring the  #CatalanReferendum hashtag

    used were. The tweets themselves were collected from the Twitter Search API
    using twarc and its twarc-archive utility. twarc-archive was run every hour
    to collect the tweets that occurred since the last run.

    violently attacking a white, mentally disabled man. The tweets were
    collected on 01/05/2017. After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag,
    #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent
    attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago,
    where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any
    connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. This link is to a CNN story

    2017 Catalonia attacks were a terrorism action against pedestrians who were
    at La Rambla (Barcelona) and beach promenade of Cambrils on the afternoon
    and night of 17-18th August 2017. We selected #NoTincPor hashtag because it
    was the motto of the demonstrations during that period and was the most
    positive message. No one knew how the situation would go so the best
    option was to collect the dataset using the search API and limit by time
    between August 17 - 26, which was the final demonstration in Barcelona for
    the victims.
