    was posted on January 3rd, 2017, showing four African American men 
    violently attacking a white, mentally disabled man. The tweets were 
    collected on 01/05/2017. After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, 
    #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent 
    attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, 
    where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any 
    connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. This link is to a CNN story

    with their sex as stated on their birth certificates rather than the
    restroom that is consistent with their gender identity
    (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act).
