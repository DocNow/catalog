    These 136,990 tweet ids represent reaction to a Facebook Live video that 
    was posted on January 3rd, 2017, showing four African American men 
    violently attacking a white, mentally disabled man. The tweets were 
    collected on 01/05/2017. After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, 
    #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent 
    attack to members of the Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, 
    where the attack took place, have found no evidence the attack has any 
    connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. This link is to a CNN story 
    documenting the police denial of Black Lives Matter connection:

    An ongoing collection of Tweets collected by NCSU Libraries using
    twarc for the key terms "HB2", "WeAreNotThis", and "BoycottNC",
    "KeepNCFair", and "ThisIsNotUs". "WeAreNotThis", "BoycottNC",
    "ThisIsNotUs", and "North Carolina" beginning on 2016-03-24, and
    "HB2" beginning on 2016-12-25. Only Tweets including "HB2", "bathroom",
    "bill", or "KeepNCFair" are included from the "North Carolina" set.
    These tags were used to discuss North Carolina House Bill 2
    (The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act), passed in March 2016,
    which includes provisions (among others) that disallow local municipalities
    from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances and also require
    individuals, when using use public bathrooms, to use those that align
    with their sex as stated on their birth certificates rather than the
    restroom that is consistent with their gender identity
    (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act).
    This dataset is broken into files of no more than 50,000 Tweet IDs each.
