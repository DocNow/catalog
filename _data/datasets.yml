    These 136,990 tweet ids represent reaction to a Facebook Live video that was posted on January 3rd, 
    2017, showing four African American men violently attacking a white, mentally disabled man. 
    The tweets were collected on 01/05/2017. After the video surfaced, the Twitter hashtag, 
    #BLMkidnapping, was created and used to incorrectly attribute the violent attack to members of the 
    Black Lives Matter movement. Police in Chicago, where the attack took place, have found no evidence 
    the attack has any connection to the Black Lives Matter movement. This link is to a CNN story 
    documenting the police denial of Black Lives Matter connection:
